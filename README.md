The Aimeos e-commerce components can integrate into almost any PHP application and uses the infrastructure of the application for building URLs, caching content, configuration settings, logging messages, session handling, sending e-mails, handling translations or managing users.

The ai-ezpublish extension provides access to the eZ Publish user table for the Aimeos components. If you are using the eZ Publish framework, you don't have to install and set up the ai-ezpublish extension yourself. Instead, use the [Aimeos eZ Publish bundle](https://github.com/aimeos/aimeos-ezpublish) to create an online shop within minutes.
